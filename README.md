    <h1>CG Sample Plugin</h1>
</div>

This sample plugin demonstrates the core capabilities of the [Common Ground Plugin Library](https://github.com/Common-Ground-DAO/CGPluginLib).

It provides a practical example of integrating the plugin library, showcasing essential frontend-backend interactions and common use cases.

Use this as a reference implementation to understand how to leverage the full feature set of CG plugins in your own applications.

## Getting Started
Install the dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```
Then run the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

The project will start running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). Unfortunately, there's not a lot of use for running this project locally since, as a plugin, it requests all its data from Common Ground when running through an iframe.

To use this plugin, you have three options:

1. Use a reverse proxy (such as ngrok):
   - [Install ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)
   - Start your local dev server: `yarn dev` 
   - In a new terminal, start ngrok: `ngrok http 5000`
   - Copy the ngrok HTTPS URL (e.g. https://abc123.ngrok.io)
   - Register this URL as your plugin on Common Ground
   - Test the plugin functionality within Common Ground's interface

   Note: Only use ngrok for development/testing. Running a production plugin through ngrok could be a security risk.


2. Deploy and test it live:
   - Host this project on a server with a public URL (e.g. using Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - Register it as a plugin on Common Ground using your public URL
   - Test the plugin functionality within Common Ground's interface

3. Use it as a reference implementation:
   - Use it as a starting point for building your own custom plugin
   - Adapt the functionality to match your specific use case
