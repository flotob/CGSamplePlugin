Great, I’ll look into actively maintained or stable open-source Flappy Bird implementations that are browser-based (JavaScript/TypeScript), mobile-friendly, and easy to embed in a React/Next.js app. I’ll also evaluate how configurable and extendable they are for embedding in both end-user and wizard-author contexts.

I’ll get back to you shortly with options and details on licensing, integration points, and customization capabilities.


# Open-Source Flappy Bird Implementations for Web Integration

## Overview

Flappy Bird clones are plentiful, but finding ones that are **actively maintained, license-friendly, and easy to embed in React/Next.js** requires careful selection. Below we review several open-source implementations (all JavaScript/TypeScript) that use HTML5 Canvas or DOM, and discuss their licenses, integration approach, event hooks, customization options, and maintenance status. We then analyze how to embed a Flappy Bird game inline in a React app (end-user view) and how a “wizard” author could configure game parameters (author view). A comparison table is provided at the end.

## Candidate Implementations

### **Floppybird (nebez/floppybird)** – *JavaScript, HTML/CSS (no canvas)*

**GitHub & License:** An early popular clone by *nebez*, licensed under **Apache-2.0**. This browser game uses regular DOM elements (divs for pipes, bird, etc.) instead of canvas, with CSS for graphics. It gained significant traction (584+ stars, 446 forks) and has inspired many forks and variations.

**Integration in React/Next:** Floppybird can be embedded in a React component by injecting its HTML/CSS/JS into a container. Because it’s pure JS/DOM, you can include its script and initialize the game on a specific `div` (e.g. via a `ref`). Minor code tweaks might be needed to mount the game into a given element instead of the document body. On mobile, Floppybird scales responsively to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.

**Game Over & Score Events:** The game displays a “Game Over” overlay and a score tally when you crash. However, by default it doesn’t emit custom events. To detect game over or live score in React, you could modify the source: e.g. trigger a custom `window` event or callback when the bird hits an obstacle or when the score variable updates. The open code makes it possible to insert such hooks. For example, one could observe the DOM (the appearance of a “Game Over” element) or patch the collision logic to call a provided function.

**Customization:** Being open-source, Floppybird is **highly extensible** – many forks have reskinned or tweaked it. It uses the original Flappy Bird art assets, but you can replace those images with custom sprites (e.g. a different bird or pipes) by swapping image URLs or CSS classes. Difficulty parameters can be adjusted: Floppybird even includes an “easy mode” toggle (with larger pipe gaps) available via a URL parameter. This indicates gravity or pipe spacing is configurable in the code. Indeed, forks have demonstrated creative modifications (e.g. voice-controlled flapping, auto-pilot mode, different themes like “Flappy Dota”). You can therefore tweak gravity, pipe gap, speed, etc., by changing constants or enabling the built-in easy mode.

**Maintenance:** Floppybird is essentially feature-complete and stable. The original repo’s last commit was \~2 years ago, but it remains a solid foundation. Its popularity has led to many community updates and forks, although the original may not see frequent commits now. Despite not being “actively” developed, it is battle-tested and easy to get running. Apache-2.0 license also permits integration into most projects freely.

### **Floppybird TypeScript (nebez/ts-floppybird)** – *TypeScript, HTML/CSS (no canvas)*

**GitHub & License:** A TypeScript refactor of Floppybird by the same author, also **Apache-2.0** licensed. It has the same gameplay and features as the original JS version, just with type safety and a more modern code structure. (It’s less known – \~8 stars – but has 125 commits suggesting a thorough port.)

**Integration in React/Next:** The integration approach is similar to the original Floppybird, with the advantage that TypeScript code may be easier to maintain or adapt in a Next.js project. You can likely import or compile this TS code and attach it to a React `useRef` container. Since it outputs the same kind of DOM-based game, it inherits Floppybird’s mobile responsiveness and embedding ease.

**Game Over & Score Events:** Out of the box, it behaves like Floppybird (no built-in React hooks), but being TypeScript, you can more confidently modify functions to add event emitters or callbacks when game state changes. Type definitions help locate the score variable or collision function to insert hooks. For example, one could add a TypeScript interface for a callback and invoke it in the game loop when score changes.

**Customization:** Because it mirrors Floppybird’s functionality, it supports the same customization capabilities (gravity, easy mode, assets, etc.). The TypeScript code is “cleaner” which may simplify adjustments to game parameters. Difficulty constants (pipe interval, jump strength, etc.) can be changed in the source. Asset injection is as simple as providing new image paths for the sprite sheet or background.

**Maintenance:** This TS version appears to be a one-off project (“rewritten in TypeScript because I was bored” as the author admits). It’s not heavily watched, but it is a stable conversion of a stable game. There are no recent issues or active development (no open issues, last commit some time ago), but it doesn’t really need active updates. It can be considered **stable** and ready for use, with the benefit of type safety for future modifications.

### **Phaser 3 Flappy Bird (IgorRozani/flappy-bird)** – *JavaScript (Phaser 3 engine, Canvas)*

**GitHub & License:** A full Flappy Bird clone built on the **Phaser 3** game framework. Licensed under **MIT**, it includes features like the original game’s menus, animations, and sounds for a polished result. This project has \~48 commits and a live demo link, indicating a reasonably complete implementation.

**Integration in React/Next:** Phaser games run inside a `<canvas>` element which can be embedded in a React component. Integration can be done by using a React hook (e.g. `useEffect`) to instantiate the Phaser game on mount, specifying a parent DOM node or canvas. Phaser allows you to pass an HTML element or ID in its config (`{ parent: <elementId> }`), so the game can render within a given React component’s div. This makes embedding straightforward via a `ref` to that div. Touch controls are supported (Phaser can handle pointer/tap input), so it’s mobile-friendly by design.

**Game Over & Score Events:** Phaser’s structured approach means the game likely has a game state or scene for “Game Over”. You could leverage Phaser’s event system – for example, dispatch an event when the bird collides with an obstacle (Phaser’s physics collision callback can be used). In this clone, the score is displayed on-screen and a “Game Over” scene is shown when you crash (the screenshot in the repo shows a Game Over screen with a restart button). To capture these events in React, one approach is to add a custom Phaser EventEmitter event (e.g. `this.events.emit('game-over', score)`) in the game code when the game ends. The React parent could subscribe to this event through the Phaser game instance. Alternatively, since you control the integration, you can check Phaser’s scene status periodically. The score value is likely stored in a variable; hooking into its update (or checking the text of the score display) is possible too. Overall, Phaser makes it feasible to implement **callbacks for game events** without hacking the DOM.

**Customization:** Using Phaser simplifies many customizations:

* **Gravity & Speed:** Phaser has physics settings. You can adjust gravity or the bird’s jump velocity easily via code constants. This clone’s source likely defines pipe spawn rate, gap size, gravity, etc., which you can tweak or expose as configuration variables.
* **Assets/Sprites:** The project uses a set of sprite images (the author credits assets from another open project). You can replace these with custom image assets by loading different files in the preload phase (or even dynamically passing URLs to load).
* **Difficulty:** Beyond gravity, things like gap size between pipes or scroll speed can be modified. If you want multiple difficulty levels, you could parameterize those values (Phaser doesn’t have a built-in “easy mode”, but you can define your own parameters).
* **Other Features:** Adding a countdown timer or life counter would require extending the logic (Phaser doesn’t include that by default). You could add a timer event that ends the game after X seconds, or track lives and reset the bird position on death until lives run out. Phaser’s scene management would help in implementing these features without too much trouble. An **autoplay demo** (where the game plays itself) is not a standard feature, but you might simulate input or use a simple AI to flap the bird to create a demo mode. (One of the Floppybird forks even had an autopilot, showing it’s doable.)

**Maintenance:** This project was created a few years ago (Phaser 3 came out around 2018). It has a modest number of stars (40+) and no recent issues, implying it’s stable in its completed form. There haven’t been recent commits (likely last updated around 2019-2020). While not under active development, the code runs on Phaser 3 which is actively maintained. If Phaser updates, minor tweaks might be needed, but generally it should continue to work. The MIT license makes it easy to integrate and modify for your needs.

### **Canvas Flappy Bird (r3nanp/flappy-bird)** – *JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas*

**GitHub & License:** A modern implementation using the Canvas API for rendering, by *Renan Pereira* (r3nanp). It’s open-sourced under **MIT**. This project appears to be actively developed/maintained – it has 180+ commits and a running demo (the author’s Vercel app) – indicating ongoing improvements. The description highlights it as a PWA (Progressive Web App) and a faithful clone using HTML Canvas.

**Integration in React/Next:** Since this game draws on a `<canvas>` element, you can embed it by including a canvas in your React component and running the game logic on it. Check the repository for how it’s structured: it likely has a main JS module that initializes the canvas and game loop. You could import that module or include it via a `<script>` in Next.js. A clean way is to create a React component that on `useEffect` calls an init function, passing it the canvas DOM node (possibly by ID or ref). The game likely already handles resizing and input; ensure the canvas element’s size or parent container is responsive for mobile. Given it’s designed as a PWA, it should be mobile-friendly out of the box (touch to flap should work if coded, or easily added via an event listener for `ontouchstart` if not already present).

**Game Over & Score Events:** In this implementation, the score is likely managed in a game loop and drawn to the canvas (and possibly stored in local storage for high score, since it mentions saving high score and showing stats). To capture the score or game-over event, you’d need to interface with the game’s code. One approach is to modify the draw/update loop to call a callback (passed in from React) whenever the game ends or when the score changes. If the code is modular, you might expose hooks – e.g., have the game accept an object with event handlers for `onScore` or `onGameOver`. If not, adding a simple `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('flappyGameOver', {detail: score}))` in the collision logic would allow React to listen on `window` for `flappyGameOver`. Similarly, emit `flappyScore` events on each point increment. This game likely uses straightforward collision detection (bird vs pipe or ground), which is easy to augment. Since the project includes a “post-game stats display”, the code already has a point where it knows the game is over and calculates stats – an ideal place to hook a Continue trigger.

**Customization:** This clone is built with modern code practices (it even has a `src` directory and presumably uses bundlers, given the presence of `package.json`). That means you can fork it and adjust parameters with ease:

* **Gravity, Gap, Speed:** Look for configuration at the top of the code (perhaps constants for gravity or pipe gap). If not explicitly configurable, you can find where the bird’s velocity is updated or pipes are spawned and change those values. The code’s readability (183 commits worth of refinements) suggests these values are not magic numbers sprinkled around but likely defined in one place.
* **Assets:** It uses Canvas drawing. Possibly it still uses sprite images (for the bird, pipe, etc.) drawn onto the canvas. If so, swap those image files in the `public` folder (the repo has an `images` folder) with your custom assets (maintaining the same dimensions or adjusting code accordingly). If the graphics are drawn programmatically or via simple shapes, you can replace them with images by loading textures in canvas.
* **Difficulty:** You can introduce an easy/hard mode by changing those same constants. For example, for easy mode, lower gravity and increase gap size; for hard mode do the opposite. Since it’s not built-in, you’d need to expose a way to set these before game start (perhaps via query params or function arguments). But given the project’s nature, adding a difficulty config (like an object of parameters) and reading it in the init function would be straightforward.
* **Timer/Lives/Autoplay:** Not provided out-of-the-box. To add a survival timer, you could start a JavaScript timer when the game starts and force game over when time runs out (or display a countdown on canvas). Lives would require modifying the game over logic: instead of resetting immediately, decrement a lives counter and restart the game until lives = 0 (then truly game over). Autoplay (AI or demo mode) would be an advanced addition – you’d have to programmatically make the bird flap at calculated intervals to avoid pipes (or simply random flaps just to show motion). This is doable (some academic projects have built AI for Flappy Bird), but not trivial. However, since this is open code, one could integrate an AI agent or script for demo purposes.

**Maintenance:** The r3nanp clone appears to be **actively maintained** or at least recently updated (as of late 2023) – a hint is the repository was updated on “Dec 17” (year unclear, but likely within the last year). With 40+ stars and the author’s own usage as a PWA, it’s likely to receive fixes or improvements. There are no open issues currently. Even if the author moves on, the code is modern and well-structured, making it easier for others to maintain or integrate. The MIT license again poses no restrictions for use in your project.

### **React/Pixi Flappy Bird (EvanBacon/react-flappy-bird)** – *React + Expo (PIXI.js)*

**GitHub & License:** A React implementation by Evan Bacon, built as a universal Expo app (runs on web via React DOM and on React Native) using the Pixi.js rendering library. It’s MIT licensed. This project is a bit older (86 stars, last commit a few years ago, \~2019) but demonstrates a Flappy Bird built with React components. Notably, it uses Expo’s Pixi integration and was deployed on web (Netlify).

**Integration in React/Next:** Since it’s already a React app, integrating it might involve extracting the game component or logic into your Next.js project. You could use it as inspiration or directly incorporate its source. The game likely consists of React components for Bird, Pipes, etc., and uses state or Redux for game logic (though being Pixi, it might manage the game loop outside of React’s render). To embed, you can render the `<Game />` component in your Next.js page. If the project cannot be imported as a package, you might copy the relevant components (ensuring you have Pixi.js or Expo GL configured). The upside is that, being React, it can interact with your app’s state more naturally. For example, it could accept props or call callback props when the game ends. In Expo/Pixi, touch input is already handled via Pixi’s interaction (so mobile tapping works). The Expo dependency might be a drawback in a plain Next.js app – however, Pixi.js can be used independently in Next.js if needed.

**Game Over & Score Events:** Evan Bacon’s implementation likely manages score in React state or in a Pixi container. If React state is used for score, you could simply watch that state. If not, you can add a hook – e.g. when the game ends, call a prop like `onGameOver(score)`. Since it’s written in React/JS, adding such a callback is straightforward. Check if the code already has something like a gameover screen component or a setState for gameOver; if yes, you can leverage that (e.g. when `gameOver` state becomes true, call a parent handler). If not, a small modification will enable capturing the event. The presence of issues in the repo (there are a few) suggests some people have tried using it; one could glean from those if any improvements were suggested (for instance, handling restarting on game over, etc.). Overall, working in React context makes event handling easier (no need for global events).

**Customization:** Being an Expo/React project, the game’s parameters might be scattered as constants or state. You can search the code for gravity or pipe gap values and modify them. If converting it to your use, you could refactor those into props or context so that you can pass in a config object. Changing assets is very feasible: since Pixi.js is used, the bird and pipe images are likely loaded as textures. You can swap those assets (the repo’s `assets` folder has images) with your own. Expo projects often use an asset pipeline, but for web you can just use image URLs or imports. Difficulty settings (speed, etc.) would require manual tuning of the variables in the code (e.g. Pixi animation delta or velocity values). Timer or life count features are not present out-of-box, but you can integrate them in the React logic (for instance, add a timer that triggers game over by dispatching the game over action after X seconds). An autoplay demo could be achieved by programmatically dispatching flap actions on an interval – since this is React, you could simulate user input by calling the same functions that a key press or tap would.

**Maintenance:** The project does not appear actively maintained (no commits in recent years, and a few open issues but no responses). However, it is stable for what it is – a demo built in 2019. Expo and Pixi have evolved, so if you use this, you might need to update some dependencies or ensure compatibility with the latest React. The appeal of this implementation is the **clean integration with React** – it was literally made with React components – which aligns with the requirement of embedding in a React/Next app. If you’re comfortable updating it, this could serve as a solid base with a permissive MIT license. Otherwise, one of the above non-React clones might be simpler to adapt with a bit of wrapper code.

## End-User Integration (Embedding & Score Trigger)

&#x20;*Example of a Flappy Bird clone reaching the “Game Over” state, displaying the score and a restart button. In a React application, we can detect this state to trigger a “Continue” action when the user achieves a target score.*

From the end-user’s perspective, the goal is to have the Flappy Bird game appear seamlessly **inline** in a webpage (e.g. as part of a Next.js step), and to know when the user has succeeded (reached a certain score) so we can unlock a “Continue” button. Achieving this involves:

* **Embedding the Game Inline:** All the implementations above can be inserted into a web page. The simplest approach is to create a React component (say `<FlappyGame />`) that encapsulates the game. Inside, you either include the game’s script or use a ref to initialize the game on a canvas/div. For example, with Phaser or the Canvas clone, you’d render a `<div ref={gameContainerRef}></div>` and in `useEffect` instantiate the game engine targeting that ref. With the DOM-based Floppybird, you might need to inject its HTML structure; you could do this by dangerously setting innerHTML of a container to the game’s `index.html` content (though a cleaner way is to refactor the game into a module). Ensuring the game fits its container is important: you might want to set the CSS width/height to 100% or a specific value for mobile versus desktop. All reviewed clones are responsive or can be made responsive (Floppybird explicitly “scales perfectly on almost any screen”, and others use canvas which you can resize to fit parent).

* **Handling Controls:** For desktop users, spacebar or click controls should work. For mobile users, taps should work. Verify that the chosen implementation supports touch events. If not, you can add an event listener for `'touchstart'` that triggers a flap (for canvas/Phaser games, call the same function as a key press; for Floppybird DOM, simulate a click or key press event). Many clones already account for mobile taps (e.g., LFSCamargo’s TS clone allows tapping the screen to flap).

* **Detecting Target Score:** We need to know when the user’s score meets or exceeds a required threshold (set by the “wizard” author). There are a couple of ways to do this:

  * **Polling/Querying:** The brute-force method is to periodically check the game’s state. For instance, if the score is rendered in the DOM (e.g., Floppybird updates an element’s text), a React component could use a `setInterval` to read that element’s content. Similarly, for canvas games, if the code exposes a `gameState` object or global, you could inspect `window.gameState.score`. Polling is not the most elegant, but it’s straightforward if you cannot easily modify the game code.

  * **Event Callbacks:** A better approach is to modify or wrap the game to emit an event when score changes or when game over happens. As discussed in each clone’s section, you can, for example, dispatch a `CustomEvent("scoreChange", { detail: newScore })` on `window` or on the game container element. The React parent can add an event listener to catch these. Alternatively, if the game is instantiated in code, pass in callback functions. E.g., for a Phaser game:

    ```js
    // Pseudocode
    const gameConfig = { ...,
       callbacks: {
         postBoot: (game) => {
            game.scene.keys.default.events.on('game-over', (finalScore) => {
               props.onGameOver(finalScore);
            });
         }
       }
    }
    new Phaser.Game(gameConfig);
    ```

    This assumes you emit `'game-over'` in the scene when the bird dies. The React component could then directly trigger the “Continue” once `onGameOver` fires with a score >= target.

    For the React/Pixi implementation, you might simply use component state/props: e.g., pass a prop `onGameOver` to the `<Game />` and inside call it when appropriate. In Floppybird’s code, you could insert `if(score >= targetScore) { /* trigger continue */ }` at the moment of collision – but better to not bake the target logic in the game; instead just emit the current score and let React decide if it’s enough.

  * **Direct State Access:** If modifying the game code is not possible (say you include a minified script), another trick is to expose some global variable. Many clones have a global like `window.score` or a `window.gameOver` flag. If you find such a variable, you can use a `useEffect` in React to watch it periodically or use a MutationObserver if it’s reflected in DOM.

* **Triggering "Continue":** Once you detect the score condition, you likely want to auto-trigger some event in your app (e.g., mark a task as complete, reveal a continue button or auto-navigate to next step). With the above event callbacks, you can call the Next.js router or a state update to indicate completion. For example, `onGameOver(score)` could set `gameOverScore` in React state; your component can then compare it to the required score prop and if satisfied, show the “Continue” button or call a provided `onComplete()` handler. If you want to automatically continue when the score is reached *before* dying (say the target is 10 points and the user hits 10 without crashing), you’d need to watch the score increment events. That can be handled with a similar event or callback on each point scored. Then once `score >= targetScore`, you could freeze the game (maybe pause the game loop or set a high gravity to drop the bird out) and call the continue action. Freezing isn’t strictly necessary – you could also allow them to continue playing but have the “Continue” button enabled as soon as they cross the threshold.

In summary, **embedding** the game is achievable with a small React wrapper, and **detecting user success** can be done by instrumenting the game’s code to communicate score updates to React. This ensures the end-user just sees a game embedded in the page, and once they hit the required score or finish the game, the app can respond (e.g., “Congratulations! Continue to the next section”).

## Wizard-Author Configuration (Customization & JSON Definition)

From the perspective of a content author configuring this Flappy Bird step in a “wizard” or tool, we want to make various game parameters adjustable without touching code each time. The implementations we’ve chosen are flexible enough to allow external configuration with some planning. Here’s how each desired setting could be supported, and how it can be serialized in a JSON definition:

* **Required Score / Target (or Time/Distance):** This is the win condition for the user. In the JSON config, you might have `"requiredScore": 5` (or a time like `"timeLimit": 30` seconds). The React wrapper will read this value and use it to decide when to trigger completion. The game code itself doesn’t need to know the target; it just needs to report score or elapsed time. For distance or time survival goals, you’d measure these similarly (e.g., time can be tracked via a timer started when game begins).

* **Difficulty Settings:** There are a few knobs:

  * **Gravity** – A higher gravity makes the bird fall faster, increasing difficulty. The JSON could have `"gravity": 0.25` (as a multiplier or specific value). The integration layer would then set the game’s gravity variable (for Phaser, `game.physics.world.gravity.y`, for others a custom variable) to this value on start.
  * **Gap Size** – The vertical space between pipes. Could be given in pixels or as a multiple of bird’s size, e.g., `"gapSize": 120`. The game’s pipe generation logic would use this value. If using Floppybird, one could enable easy mode by a flag; for more granular control, you’d replace any hardcoded gap with this config value.
  * **Obstacle Speed / Scroll Speed** – Faster moving pipes make the game harder. Config example: `"pipeSpeed": 2.0` (where 1.0 is normal). The code that moves pipes leftwards would multiply by this factor.
  * **Jump Strength** – How forcefully the bird flaps. Could be `"flapVelocity": -4.5` (a negative Y velocity). Tuning this along with gravity affects difficulty.
  * These settings can be stored under a JSON key like `"difficulty": { "gravity": X, "gap": Y, ... }`. When the game initializes, it reads these values and applies them. If a particular implementation doesn’t support one of them inherently, the integration might approximate it (for instance, Floppybird’s easy mode is essentially a preset of gap and velocity).

* **Custom Asset URLs:** To allow theming, the JSON could provide URLs or asset names for the bird sprite, pipe image, background image, etc. For example:

  ```json
  "assets": {
    "birdSprite": "https://example.com/mybird.png",
    "pipeImage": "/assets/space-pipe.png",
    "background": "/assets/sky.png"
  }
  ```

  The React component or game loader would then use these URLs when loading images (instead of default ones). All our candidate games allow swapping assets – you just need to ensure the format/dimensions are compatible (or also configurable).

* **Timer or Life Count:** If an author wants the game to last a fixed duration or give the user X tries:

  * **Timer:** JSON could have `"timeLimit": 60` (seconds). The wrapper can start a countdown and force game over when time is up (or just consider surviving the time as success). Implementing this might involve overlaying a timer display (which we can do in React or canvas) and stopping input when done. Alternatively, we can treat it as another win condition: survive 60 seconds = pass.
  * **Lives:** JSON example: `"lives": 3`. The game would allow 3 crashes before final game over. To implement, we wrap the game such that on crash, if lives remain, we automatically restart the game (perhaps with a “Life lost” message) and decrement lives. Only when lives are 0 do we present the real game over to the user. This is more custom logic, but feasible to add around the game loop. We’d maintain the lives count in React state and reset the game by re-initializing or calling a restart function.

* **Autoplay Demo Preview:** To show a demo (attract mode), one could have a config `"autoplayDemo": true` or even provide a recording of inputs. If true, upon loading the game, it could start in a non-interactive autoplay mode – e.g., using an AI or scripted input. This is complex to do generically. A simpler way: some clones allow an AI mode (FlappyBird AI projects exist, but not in these implementations by default). Another approach is to play a pre-recorded sequence: e.g., run the game hidden and record the bird’s positions to replay, or just visually loop through some animations. This feature might be less common to implement due to complexity. In a wizard JSON, it might be a boolean flag or an object like `"demoMode": { "enabled": true, "type": "auto" }`. For now, if needed, one could simulate random flapping just for show until the user actively starts the game (perhaps by a click). For example, floppybird could be started in “debug” mode and auto flap (one fork added autopilot). Implementing this likely requires custom coding beyond configuration, so it should be clearly documented for authors if it’s available.

* **Saving Settings in JSON:** The wizard-definition JSON would contain all the above fields, allowing re-editing later. For instance:

  ```json
  {
    "game": "flappy-bird",
    "requiredScore": 10,
    "difficulty": { "gap": 140, "gravity": 0.25, "pipeSpeed": 1.2 },
    "assets": { "bird": "bird2.png", "pipe": "pipe_gold.png", "bg": "night_sky.png" },
    "timeLimit": null,
    "lives": 3,
    "autoplayDemo": false
  }
  ```

  The React integration code would parse this JSON and initialize the chosen Flappy Bird implementation accordingly. Because the implementations are open-source, we can modify them to accept these parameters (for example, expose a function `startGame(config)` that overrides default settings). Once these settings are wired up, authors without coding can tweak values in the JSON and see the game’s behavior change.

In essence, the chosen Flappy Bird clones are **extensible enough to allow external configuration**. It requires some one-time effort to connect the JSON config to the game’s internals (through props, events, or modified constants), but once done, you get a flexible mini-game module. The wizard author can then treat it as a configurable component: set the win conditions, adjust difficulty to match user skill, apply a custom skin or theme, and even decide if the user can try again or not (lives), all through JSON. These settings are saved and can be loaded for later editing or reuse, making the game element a robust part of the interactive toolkit.

## Comparison of Implementations

Below is a summary of the reviewed Flappy Bird implementations and how they stack up on key factors:

| **Floppybird** (JS, DOM elements)      | Apache-2.0  | Manual init in ref container; mobile scaling built-in.                                 | No built-in events – add DOM or window events on collision or poll score.                             | Gravity, gap (has easy mode); swap sprites; widely forked so mods exist.                               | Stable, no recent commits (hype-era) but very proven.                       |
| **Floppybird-TS** (TS, DOM)            | Apache-2.0  | Similar to Floppybird JS; easier to integrate in TS projects.                          | Same approach – modify TS code to emit callbacks (type-safe).                                         | Same as Floppybird (clone functionality) – constants easily tweaked.                                   | One-time port; not active, but doesn’t need updates.                        |
| **Phaser3 Flappy** (Canvas, Phaser)    | MIT         | Initialize Phaser in a React `useEffect` with parent div ID; touch support via Phaser. | Use Phaser events (e.g. emit on gameover) or check scene state; easy to hook into Phaser’s lifecycle. | Physics params (gravity, velocity), pipe gap, spawn rate; replace asset images easily.                 | Moderately maintained (complete); no new features but Phaser still updated. |
| **Canvas Flappy** (JS Canvas API)      | MIT         | Render a `<canvas>` in React and call game init on it; designed as PWA, so responsive. | Expose global events or callbacks in game loop for score/life; or poll a global `score`.              | Configurable code structure; adjust constants or pass config (if forked); supports sound, high-scores. | Active/Recent (many commits, 2023); likely to accept contributions.         |
| **React Pixi (Expo)** (React + WebGL)  | MIT         | Native React component structure – import or copy component; may require Pixi setup.   | Leverage React state/props: e.g. callback prop on game over; or monitor internal state changes.       | Props could be added for gravity/speed; swap asset files; code tweaks needed to expose config.         | Inactive (last update \~2019); works but Expo/Pixi deps are older.          |

Each of these implementations can be made to work in a modern React/Next.js setup with some integration effort. The choice may come down to how much you value a **ready-to-go React component** (the Evan Bacon version) versus a **lightweight, popular implementation** (Floppybird) or a **feature-rich, structured game** (Phaser or the Canvas clone). In terms of extensibility and React embedding, using Phaser or the Canvas clone with a small wrapper might provide the cleanest solution – you get structured game logic and an easy way to inject config – whereas Floppybird’s appeal is simplicity and community validation.

All options are license-compatible (MIT or Apache) with your needs. They can all be made to meet the mobile-friendly and customizable criteria. By prioritizing a bit of upfront integration work (adding event hooks and config parameters), you’ll be able to deliver an inline Flappy Bird challenge that authors can tailor and users can enjoy without ever leaving your React application’s flow.
