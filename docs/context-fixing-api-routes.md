# Research Prompt: Next.js App Router Dynamic Parameters Issue in Credential Verification System

## Background Context

I've built a credential verification system in a Next.js 15.1.6 application using the App Router. The system allows users to complete a wizard by verifying their ENS (Ethereum Name Service) credentials. When a step is completed, the system should:

1. Mark the step as complete in the database
2. Show a summary when all steps are complete
3. Mark the wizard as completed in the database
4. Assign roles to the user based on completed steps

## Observed Issues

In the development environment, we're seeing two critical issues:

1. **Infinite Verification Loop**:
   - The ENS verification step keeps triggering repeatedly
   - Console logs show: "Completing step [id] for wizard [id]" and "ENS Verification detected: [name]" in an endless cycle
   - React's Fast Refresh keeps rebuilding during this process
   - This prevents the wizard from ever being marked as complete

2. **Next.js Dynamic Params Error**:
   ```
   Error: Route "/api/user/wizards/[wizardId]/steps" used `params.wizardId`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis
   ```

3. **Role Assignment Never Happening**: 
   - Due to the verification loop, the system never reaches the point of assigning roles

## Critical Implementation Details

1. **API Route Structure**:
   ```typescript
   // Updated after previous fixes
   export const GET = withAuth(async (req, context) => {
     const { wizardId } = context.params; // This line triggers the error
     // ...
   });
   ```

2. **Auth Wrapper Function**:
   ```typescript
   export function withAuth(handler, adminOnly = false) {
     return async (req, context) => {
       // JWT verification logic...
       return await handler(authReq, context);
     };
   }
   ```

3. **React Effects for Verification**:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     // Added safety checks but still loops
     if (step.completed_at) return;
     
     const hasPrimaryEns = !!ensDetails?.name;
     if (isConnected && address && !detailsLoading && hasPrimaryEns && !isVerifying) {
       // Verification logic with local flag
       let isVerifyingLocally = false;
       if (isVerifyingLocally) return;
       
       isVerifyingLocally = true;
       // Verify credential...
     }
   }, [dependencies]);
   ```

4. **Environment Difference**:
   - Issues primarily manifest in development environment
   - Less frequent or not observed in production

## Research Questions

1. What is the correct way to handle dynamic route parameters in Next.js App Router API routes? Does the entire `params` object need to be awaited?

2. What's causing the infinite verification loop? Is it related to:
   - React Query's retry mechanism
   - React's development mode behavior
   - Fast Refresh rebuilding the component
   - State management issues in our effects

3. Why might these issues appear in development but not production?

4. How should we properly structure API route handlers with authentication and dynamic parameters in Next.js App Router?

5. What's the most robust approach to prevent useEffect-based verification loops, especially when dealing with async operations?

Please analyze these issues and provide a comprehensive explanation of what's happening and how to properly fix it.
"

i then asked these questions for more context: 

"	1.	Are you using the app directory (App Router) exclusively, or is there any legacy pages directory code still in use?
	2.	For the infinite loop, is the verify credential logic inside the useEffect making API calls that could themselves trigger state updates?
	3.	Is any client-side caching mechanism (like React Query or SWR) in use that may be affecting re-renders or triggering data fetches?
	4.	Do you want solutions strictly for development debugging, or are you also looking to harden the production behavior?"



the agent responed with these answers:

"
Here are the answers to your questions based on my analysis of the code I've seen:

## 1. App Router Usage

Yes, you're using the App Router exclusively. All your API routes follow the `/src/app/api/...` pattern, and the error message specifically mentions App Router's dynamic route handling. There's no evidence of legacy pages directory code in the snippets I've seen.

## 2. Verify Credential Logic and Infinite Loops

Yes, the verify credential logic inside the useEffect is making API calls that trigger state updates, creating a potential circular dependency:

```javascript
// Inside useEffect
verifyCredential({
  ensName: ensDetails.name,
  address: address
}).then(() => {
  // Call onComplete to signal the wizard to advance
  onComplete();
});
```

This flow seems problematic because:
- verifyCredential calls an API endpoint
- The API response triggers state updates
- onComplete likely updates parent component state
- State changes cause component re-renders
- useEffect runs again, despite our attempts at local flags

## 3. Client-side Caching

Yes, React Query is being used extensively:

```javascript
// In hooks like useCompleteStepMutation
const completeStepMutation = useMutation<void, Error, CompleteStepVariables | undefined>({
  // ...mutation logic
  onSuccess: () => {
    // Invalidates queries, potentially triggering more re-renders
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['userWizardSteps', wizardId] });
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['userWizards'] });
  }
});
```

React Query's behavior is likely contributing to the problem:
- Its retry mechanism retries failed requests automatically
- Query invalidation triggers refetches and re-renders
- The `staleTime` and caching settings may need adjustment

## 4. Development vs. Production Focus

Based on your comment about not experiencing the issue much in production, you need solutions that address both environments:

1. **Development-specific fixes**:
   - Proper handling of Fast Refresh cycles
   - Better error messages for debugging API issues

2. **Production hardening**:
   - More robust state management to prevent infinite loops
   - Proper error handling and recovery
   - Improved React Query configuration to manage retries and cache invalidation

The most urgent issue to fix is the Next.js dynamic params requirement - this is a fundamental App Router requirement that needs to be addressed for both environments to work correctly."


the research ai came back with this, which i gave our agent:

"1 ‚Äî The ‚Äúparams should be awaited‚Äù error

Since Next.js 15 every helper that exposes request-specific data (params, searchParams, cookies(), headers(), ‚Ä¶) returns a Promise. The docs literally say:

export default async function Page({
  params,            // ‚¨Ö Promise
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params      // ‚úÖ must await
}
```  [oai_citation:0‚Ä°Next.js by Vercel - The React Framework](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)

Attempting to read a property synchronously (`context.params.wizardId`) throws the warning you‚Äôre seeing.  
The Stack Overflow thread you found describes the same thing and shows the exact fix: unwrap the promise first.  [oai_citation:1‚Ä°Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79145063/params-should-be-awaited-nextjs15)

---

#### What that means for a wrapped handler

```ts
// app/api/user/wizards/[wizardId]/steps/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { withAuth } from '@/lib/withAuth'

export const GET = withAuth(
  async (req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: Promise<{ wizardId: string }> }) => {
    const { wizardId } = await params            // üëà after await it‚Äôs just a string
    // ‚Ä¶do work, return NextResponse
  },
)

and make the wrapper forward the resolved params:

export const withAuth =
  <Ctx extends { params: any }>(
    handler: (req: NextRequest, ctx: { params: Awaited<Ctx['params']> }) => Promise<NextResponse>,
    adminOnly = false,
  ) =>
  async (req: NextRequest, ctx: Ctx) => {
    const params = await ctx.params              // <-- key line
    const user = await verifyJwt(req, adminOnly)
    return handler(req, { ...ctx, params })
  }

After that fix the API no longer crashes, so the front-end can really mark the step complete.

‚∏ª

2 ‚Äî Why you got an infinite verification loop
	1.	API keeps throwing
Because of the params bug every mutation returns 500, so step.completed_at never gets set.
	2.	React Query keeps retrying
useMutation / useQuery retries failed requests three times by default and can even retry indefinitely if retry: true.  Ôøº
	3.	useEffect runs twice in dev
React 18 Strict-Mode deliberately mounts, unmounts and remounts every component once in the dev server. Effects therefore fire twice.  Ôøº
	4.	Local flag isn‚Äôt stable
let isVerifyingLocally = false is re-declared on every render, so it never really prevents anything.

Put all of that together and you see the log spam and endless fast-refresh.

‚∏ª

3 ‚Äî Why it looks fine in production
	‚Ä¢	Prod builds don‚Äôt run Strict Mode‚Äôs double-mount, so effects run once.
	‚Ä¢	Turbopack / dev compiler highlights async-params errors that the prod compiler sometimes tree-shakes away, so the bug is only visible locally.
	‚Ä¢	React Query‚Äôs automatic retries still happen in prod, but because the handler doesn‚Äôt crash any more they resolve on the first attempt.

‚∏ª

4 ‚Äî Hardening the API + auth layer
	‚Ä¢	Always type params as Promise<‚Ä¶> inside App-Router handlers.
	‚Ä¢	Unwrap it in exactly one place (either the HOF or the handler, never half-half).
	‚Ä¢	Return typed NextResponse.json({ ‚Ä¶ }) so the client can narrow success vs. error.
	‚Ä¢	If you need early bail-outs (e.g. 403), throw NextResponse.json('Forbidden', { status: 403 }) directly from the wrapper.

‚∏ª

5 ‚Äî Preventing client-side verification loops

const verifyingRef = useRef(false)

const mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: verifyEns,
  retry: false,                       // disable auto-retries for this mutation
  onSuccess: () => queryClient.invalidateQueries(['wizard', wizardId]),
})

useEffect(() => {
  if (step.completed_at) return
  if (!isConnected || detailsLoading) return
  if (!ensDetails?.name) return
  if (verifyingRef.current) return

  verifyingRef.current = true
  mutation.mutate()
}, [isConnected, detailsLoading, ensDetails?.name, step.completed_at])

	‚Ä¢	useRef stores the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already verifying‚Äù flag across renders without causing new renders.
	‚Ä¢	The dependency list is minimal, so the effect can‚Äôt re-fire spuriously.
	‚Ä¢	retry: false means a single failure surfaces immediately instead of looping.
	‚Ä¢	Put any long-running async call inside the mutation, never directly in the effect.

If you still want automatic retries, make them exponential and capped (retry: 5, retryDelay: attempt => Math.min(1000 * 2**attempt, 30_000)).

‚∏ª

Quick checklist

Layer	What to verify	One-liner fix
API route	params must be awaited before destructuring	const { wizardId } = await params
HOF wrapper	forward await ctx.params	see wrapper code above
React Query	disable retries for ‚Äúwrite‚Äù operations	retry: false
Effect	make guard stable	useRef or store a verifying flag in React Query state
Dev vs Prod	Strict-Mode double mount is expected	don‚Äôt fight it‚Äîwrite idempotent effects

Once the handler stops erroring and the effect can only fire once, the wizard reaches its success state and your role-assignment logic finally runs."
