Great. I’ll research the standard process for handling third-party authentication or checkout flows like Stripe in a way that works across both mobile and desktop—specifically using a separate browser tab for the redirect and returning control to the original window.

I'll focus on how to implement this flow in a Next.js environment, where the plugin (iframe) can communicate with the new tab, handle the callback securely, and return to a consistent state without opening additional tabs for the user.
I'll get back to you shortly with a step-by-step explanation.


# Handling Stripe Checkout in a New Tab (Next.js Guide)

**Overview:** We’ll refactor a Stripe Checkout flow to open in a **new browser tab** instead of the same tab. The Stripe **success/cancel redirects** will point to pages on our Next.js plugin (in the new tab), which will then communicate the payment result back to the original page (where the plugin UI is embedded). This approach preserves the original page’s state (no full-page redirect) and improves user experience (especially on mobile). Below is a step-by-step guide with best practices for inter-tab communication and compatibility.

## Why Use a New Tab for Checkout?

* **Preserve App State:** Opening Checkout in a new tab means the original page (and any React state or playing media) remains loaded. The user’s context isn’t lost by a full page redirect. For example, a music site could continue playing music while payment happens in a separate tab.
* **Mobile Experience:** Stripe’s own UX research found that using a new browser window on mobile provides a more reliable payment experience than embedding or redirecting in-frame. A new tab avoids issues with limited frame support on mobile and gives Stripe full control to optimize the payment UI on all devices. Users can simply close the tab to return to your app.
* **Avoid Query Param Limitations:** Relying on query parameters in the redirect URL requires the original page to reload or parse those params. In a single-page app, this can be cumbersome and might reset state. On mobile browsers (or in-app webviews), redirecting back via a URL can fail or not return to the correct context without custom deep linking. By handling the result in a new tab and using messaging, we ensure the original tab doesn’t need to navigate at all, avoiding URL length limits or navigation issues on mobile.
* **Smooth Cancellation Flow:** In the same-tab flow, if a user cancels payment, they’re stuck on a Stripe cancellation page or have to navigate back manually. With a new tab, you can catch the cancel event and simply close the tab, keeping the user on the original screen (or show a message to try again).

## High-Level Flow

1. **User initiates Checkout** (e.g. clicks “Pay”) on the original page.
2. **Create a Stripe Checkout Session** via your Next.js backend (set its `success_url` and `cancel_url` to routes on your app).
3. **Open Stripe in a new tab:** The frontend opens a new window (tab) to the Stripe Checkout URL (or a placeholder page that will redirect to Stripe). The original window remains open.
4. **Payment is completed on Stripe:** The user submits payment on Stripe’s hosted page. Stripe then redirects that tab to the specified success or cancel URL on your Next.js app (e.g. `/checkout/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`).
5. **Handle the result in the new tab:** The Next.js page loaded on success (or cancel) runs a script to communicate the outcome back to the original page.
6. **Original page receives message:** The plugin (original window, possibly an iframe) listens for the success/cancel message. Upon receiving it, it can update UI (e.g. show a confirmation or refresh data).
7. **Close the checkout tab:** After sending the message, the new tab closes itself, returning focus to the original page.

The following sections break down these steps with implementation details.

## Step 1: Initiating Stripe Checkout in a New Tab

**Create the Checkout Session (Next.js API Route):** On the server side, use Stripe’s API to create a Checkout Session with appropriate redirect URLs. For example, in Next.js you might have an API route (`pages/api/create-checkout-session.js`) that returns a session URL:

```js
// pages/api/create-checkout-session.js
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // TODO: parse items or payment details from req.body
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    success_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/checkout/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/checkout/cancel`,
    mode: 'payment',
    // ...other parameters like line_items, customer, etc.
  });
  res.status(200).json({ url: session.url });
}
```

Here we set the `success_url` to a page on our app (`/checkout/success`) and include `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` so Stripe will append the session ID as a query param. The `cancel_url` is a page to handle cancellations. (Stripe documentation notes that after payment, it will redirect the user to the return page you host.)

**Open the new tab on user action:** In your React frontend (Next.js page/component), open the Stripe Checkout URL in a new tab. This should be triggered by a user gesture (e.g. button click) to avoid popup blockers. For example:

```jsx
// In a React component (e.g. CheckoutButton.jsx)
const handleCheckout = async () => {
  // 1. Immediately open a new tab (to avoid popup blocker)
  const checkoutTab = window.open('/redirecting.html', '_blank');  
  // (Optional: '/redirecting.html' is a simple page that says "Redirecting to Stripe..." 
  // or you can use about:blank)

  // 2. Create the Checkout Session via API
  const res = await fetch('/api/create-checkout-session', { method: 'POST' });
  const data = await res.json();

  if (data.url) {
    // 3. Redirect the new tab to Stripe Checkout
    checkoutTab.location.href = data.url;
  } else {
    // Handle error (close temp tab if session creation failed)
    checkoutTab.close();
    alert('Failed to start checkout');
  }
};
<button onClick={handleCheckout}>Pay with Stripe</button>
```

In this snippet, we open a new tab *immediately* when the button is clicked, then fetch the session URL. Opening `window.open` during the click event ensures most browsers won’t block the popup. We navigate the new window to the Stripe URL once we have it. (If you already have the Stripe Checkout URL beforehand, you can simply `window.open(stripeUrl, '_blank')` directly.)

**Note:** Opening an intermediate page (`/redirecting.html`) is optional. It could just be `about:blank` or a small Next.js page that perhaps shows a loading indicator. The key is the new window is opened by a user gesture. Once the new tab starts loading Stripe’s site, the user will be on the Stripe-hosted checkout.

## Step 2: Handling the Stripe Redirect in the New Tab

After payment, Stripe will redirect the new tab to the URLs we provided:

* On success: e.g. `https://yourapp.com/checkout/success?session_id=cs_test_a1b2c3...`
* On cancel: e.g. `https://yourapp.com/checkout/cancel`

We need to create these pages (`pages/checkout/success.jsx` and `pages/checkout/cancel.jsx` in Next.js, for example) to handle the result.

**Success page logic (`/checkout/success`):**

On the success page, you might want to verify the payment and then notify the original window. For example, you could use the `session_id` in the query to fetch the session details from your backend (or Stripe API) to double-check the payment status. However, since Stripe only redirects here after a successful payment attempt, you can assume success and proceed to notify the original page.

In the success page component, use an effect or script to send a message back to the opener and then close the tab. One modern approach is using the **BroadcastChannel API**:

```jsx
// pages/checkout/success.jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function CheckoutSuccess() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const sessionId = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('session_id');
    // (Optional: verify sessionId with server via fetch here)

    // Notify other contexts (e.g., original tab) about success
    const bc = new BroadcastChannel('stripe_checkout');
    bc.postMessage({ status: 'success', sessionId });
    bc.close();  // close channel after use

    // Close this tab
    window.close();
  }, []);

  return <h1>Payment Successful!</h1>;
}
```

In this code, we open a BroadcastChannel named `"stripe_checkout"` and post a message containing the result (you can include more info as needed). Then we call `window.close()` to shut the tab. The original page, if it has subscribed to the same channel, will receive the message. We also display a quick message (“Payment Successful!”) in case the tab doesn’t close immediately (some browsers might not allow `window.close()` unless the page was opened via `window.open` – here it was, so it should succeed).

**Cancel page logic (`/checkout/cancel`):**

For cancellations, you can implement similar logic. For instance, post a message with `{status: 'canceled'}` and close the tab. Alternatively, you might choose not to auto-close on cancel and instead instruct the user to return, but typically sending a cancel message and closing makes for a seamless experience.

Example cancel handler:

```jsx
// pages/checkout/cancel.jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const bc = new BroadcastChannel('stripe_checkout');
  bc.postMessage({ status: 'cancel' });
  bc.close();
  window.close();
}, []);
```

## Step 3: Communicating the Result Back to the Original Tab

The critical part of this pattern is **inter-tab communication** – letting the original window know what happened in the checkout tab. There are a few robust ways to do this:

* **BroadcastChannel (Recommended):** The BroadcastChannel API provides a pub-sub channel that any script on the *same origin* can join. It’s ideal for communicating between the checkout tab and the original page, as long as both share origin. In our example, the success page posted to channel `"stripe_checkout"`. In the original page (the plugin), we set up a listener on that channel:

  ```jsx
  // In the original page (or plugin iframe) script:
  useEffect(() => {
    const bc = new BroadcastChannel('stripe_checkout');
    bc.onmessage = (event) => {
      if (event.data.status === 'success') {
        // e.g. Payment succeeded – update state, show confirmation
        console.log('Payment successful, session:', event.data.sessionId);
        // perhaps trigger a refresh or call backend to fetch updated info
      } else if (event.data.status === 'cancel') {
        console.log('Payment was canceled by user.');
        // handle cancellation (maybe prompt to retry)
      }
    };
    return () => bc.close();
  }, []);
  ```

  The BroadcastChannel approach is clean and real-time – any window (or iframe) on the same origin that opens the channel will receive messages from others. It’s supported in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and as of 2022 in Safari 15.4+). This API was designed for exactly this use case.

* **LocalStorage Events (Fallback):** If you need to support older browsers or Safari versions that don’t have BroadcastChannel, you can use the `localStorage` event as a fallback. Writing to localStorage in one tab triggers a `storage` event in other tabs of the same origin. For example, the success page could do:

  ```js
  localStorage.setItem('checkoutResult', JSON.stringify({ status: 'success', sessionId }));
  window.close();
  ```

  And the original page could listen:

  ```js
  window.addEventListener('storage', (e) => {
    if (e.key === 'checkoutResult') {
      const data = JSON.parse(e.newValue);
      if (data.status === 'success') {
        // handle success
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  This works cross-tab as long as the origin matches. Be aware of some caveats: Safari in private mode doesn’t fire storage events or allow localStorage writes, and you’ll want to clear the key or use unique keys to avoid repeatedly handling old events. Despite these quirks, it’s a common fallback for broad compatibility.

* **`window.postMessage` (Cross-origin or direct messaging):** If your integration involves cross-origin communication (for example, if the plugin is embedded as an iframe on a different domain than your checkout pages), the above methods might not work due to browser partitioning. In such cases, you can fall back to `window.postMessage()`, which allows safe communication between windows even across origins.

  How this works: the new tab can access a reference to its opener via `window.opener`. Using `postMessage`, it can send a message that the opener can receive. For instance, in the success page script (new tab):

  ```js
  window.opener.postMessage({ status: 'success', sessionId }, "https://your-plugin-domain.com");
  window.close();
  ```

  And in the original page (the opener), listen for the message:

  ```js
  window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    if (event.origin === "https://your-plugin-domain.com" && event.data.status === 'success') {
      // Received success message from checkout tab
    }
  });
  ```

  The `postMessage` API requires specifying a target origin for security, which should be your domain. This method is a bit more manual but works even if the new tab is considered a different top-level context. In fact, `window.postMessage` is specifically suited for parent<->popup communication. Use this if BroadcastChannel/localStorage won’t work (for example, Safari isolates third-party iframes storage, preventing BroadcastChannel in an embedded context).

**Security Tip:** No matter which method you use, ensure you only react to messages from your expected origin. In the examples above, we check `event.origin` or use same-origin channels. This prevents malicious sites from spoofing a message.

## Step 4: Closing the Checkout Tab and Restoring Focus

After sending the success/cancel message, the new tab should close itself via `window.close()`. Browsers allow a script to close a window **only** if that window was opened via script. Since we used `window.open`, we have that ability. The snippet on the success page already calls `window.close()` after posting the message. If the browser refuses to close (edge case: e.g. if the user somehow navigated directly to the success URL without the opener), you may simply show a message like “Payment processed, please return to the original tab.” In practice, if opened properly, it should close automatically.

On the original page, because we never navigated away, the user is right where they left off. You might want to give some visual indication that the payment succeeded (e.g. show a confirmation modal, refresh cart status, etc.). Since the original page was listening for the message, it can now update the UI accordingly.

## Additional Best Practices and Considerations

* **Ensure the new tab opens** – Popup blockers can prevent `window.open`. By opening the tab during a user event (as shown in Step 1), you minimize this risk. If you must open the tab outside a direct event (not recommended), consider using a short-lived blank tab as we did.
* **Use `rel="noopener"` when appropriate:** If you ever open a third-party URL in a new tab without needing to communicate back, add the `noopener` attribute (or set `newWindow.opener = null` in code) to prevent the new page from gaining access to the `window.opener`. This is a security measure to stop untrusted pages from manipulating the opener. In our case, we *do* need `window.opener` (or a shared context) for communication, so we intentionally keep it. We trust Stripe’s page, but generally, be cautious when opening external links.
* **Mobile browsers:** The new-tab flow works on mobile Chrome/Safari, but note that mobile UI may treat a “new tab” as a separate view. iOS Safari, for example, will open a new page instance. The user can close it to return to your app. This is usually smoother than a full redirect. If your Next.js app is actually running inside a WebView (like an Ionic/Capacitor app or similar), `window.open` might open the system browser. In such cases, you may need an alternate approach (like using Stripe’s Mobile SDK or handling the success via deep link). For web scenarios, however, the described pattern is compatible with mobile browsers.
* **Handling failures:** Not all checkout sessions end in success or cancel – consider network errors or the user just closing the Stripe tab without completing payment. In those cases, your original page might never get a message. It’s good to have a timeout or a way to recover (e.g. poll session status after some time, or let the user retry if they think something went wrong). Usually, if the user simply closes the Stripe tab, you can treat it similar to a cancellation (no confirmation received).
* **Post-payment verification:** For critical actions (like granting access to content or fulfilling an order), don’t rely solely on the client-side message. Use the Stripe `session_id` to verify the payment on your server (e.g. via Stripe’s API or webhook) before finalizing the order. The client message is mainly for UI/UX feedback. Securely verify payment on the backend for trust but synchronize that with the front-end for a smooth user experience.

## Conclusion

By opening Stripe Checkout in a new tab and using inter-tab communication, we achieve a smoother checkout flow that keeps the original app state intact. This is a common pattern for third-party integrations where you don’t want an external flow to disrupt your single-page application. Stripe themselves have encouraged opening their Checkout outside of iframes for better compatibility. Using **BroadcastChannel** (with a localStorage or `postMessage` fallback) is a reliable way to transmit the result back to the originating tab in a secure manner. This architecture is compatible with Next.js – leveraging its API routes for session creation and pages for the return URLs. Following these steps, you can provide a seamless payment experience across desktop and mobile, while maintaining control over your application’s state.
